# CNN Image Classification (MNIST & CIFAR-10)

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from two popular datasets: **MNIST** (handwritten digits) and **CIFAR-10** (natural images like dogs, planes, etc).

The entire pipeline â€” from data loading to visualization â€” is contained in a single script: `CNN.py`.

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Loads & preprocesses MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
- ðŸ§± Implements two CNN architectures:
  - Simple CNN (basic model)
  - Deep CNN (stacked Conv layers)
- ðŸ“‰ Trains and validates models with EarlyStopping
- ðŸ“ˆ Generates:
  - Sample image grids
  - Accuracy/loss plots
  - Confusion matrix
  - Prediction previews (color-coded)
- ðŸ§ª Evaluation using accuracy & classification reports

---

## ðŸ“¦ Datasets

- **MNIST**: 28x28 grayscale digits (0â€“9)
- **CIFAR-10**: 32x32 RGB images in 10 classes (airplane, dog, truck, etc.)
